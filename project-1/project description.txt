Task:
Create an application that simulates banking operations, consisting of the following components:

**Model Layer:**
Define three properties to represent the core attributes of the banking system.

**Service Layer:**
Define three behaviors (methods) that encapsulate the essential operations within a banking system: deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry.

**Main Application:**
Implement the core business operations using the service layer's defined behaviors: deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry.

After completing the primary tasks, conduct comprehensive testing of the service layer methods and ensure that the code is well-documented using JavaDocs. Finally, package the application into a JAR file to facilitate distribution and use.
